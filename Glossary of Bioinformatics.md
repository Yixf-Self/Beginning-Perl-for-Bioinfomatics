============
[Locus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_%28genetics%29): In genetics, a locus (plural loci) is the specific location of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome. 

[MicroRNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA): A microRNA (abbr. miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule (ca. 22 nucleotides) found in plants and animals, which functions in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.  

[Transcriptional factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor): In molecular biology and genetics, a transcription factor (sometimes called a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA.  

[Protein–protein interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction): Protein–protein interactions occur when two or more proteins bind together, often to carry out their biological function.  

[Signal transduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction): Signal transduction occurs when an extracellular signaling molecule activates a cell surface receptor. In turn, this receptor alters intracellular molecules creating a response.[2] There are two stages in this process:
* signaling molecule activates a specific receptor protein on the cell membrane.
* second messenger transmits the signal into the cell, eliciting a physiological response.
