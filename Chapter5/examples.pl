#The final example is unlessâ€”the opposite of if. It works like the English word
#"unless": e.g., "Unless you study Russian literature, you are ignorant of Chekov." If the
#conditional evaluates to true, no action is taken; if it evaluates to false, the associated
#statements are executed. If "you study Russian literature" is false, "you are ignorant of
#Chekov."
